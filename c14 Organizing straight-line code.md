### 14.1 Statements that must be in a specific order

`KP:` when statements have dependencies, take steps to make the dependencies clear:
+ organize code so that deps are obvious
+ name routines so that deps are obvious
+ use routine parameters to make deps obvious
+ document unclear deps with comments
+ check for deps with assertions or error-handling code

### 14.2 Statement whose order doesn't matter 

+ making code read from top to bottom
+ grouping related statements
