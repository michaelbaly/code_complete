A table-driven method is a `schema` that allows you to look up information in table rather than using logic statement to figure it out
### 18.1 general considerations in using TDM(Table-Driven Methods)
`KP:` used in appropriate circumstances, TD code is simpler than complicated logic, easier to modify, and more efficient.

1. two issues using TDM `KP`
    + how to look up entries in the table ? 
        + Direct access
        + Indexed access
        + stair-step access
    + what you should store in the table ?

    + logic-based approach
    + obj-oriented approach
    + `table-driven approach`
4. fudging lookup keys - several ways:
    + duplicate information to make the key work directly
