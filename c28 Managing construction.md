This chapter discusses a few specific management topics that apply directly to construction

### 28.1 Encouraging good coding
* if someone on a project is going to define standards, have a respected architect define the standards rather than the manager.

#### Considerations in setting standards

#### Techniques for encouraging good coding
* assign two people to every part of the project
* review every line of code
* require code sign-offs - before code is considered to be complete, senior technical personnel must sign the code listing
* route good code examples for review
* emphasize that code listings are public assets
* reward good code - Use your organizationâ€™s reward system to reinforce good coding practices
* one easy standard

### 28.2 Configuration management

#### What is configuration management ?
* ... is the practice of identifying project artifacts and handling changes systematically so that a system can maintain its integrity over time.

#### Requirements and design changes - guidelines for controlling design changes:
* follow a systematic change-control procedure
* handle change requests in groups - write down all ideas and suggestions
* estimate the cost of each change
* be wary of high change volumes
* establish a `change-control board` or its equivalent in a way that makes sense for your project
* watch for bureaucracy, but don't let the fear of bureaucracy preclude effective change control

#### Software code changes
* version-control software 

#### Tool versions
* compilers, linkers, code libs, etc. -> version-control (if necessary)

#### Machine configurations

#### Backup plan
* your work - periodically


### 28.3 Estimating a construction schedule

#### Estimation approaches
* use estimating software
* use an algorithmic approach
* have outside estimation experts estimate the project
* have a walk-through meeting for estimates
* esimate pieces and then add together
* have people estimate their own tasks, and then add together
* refer to experience on previous projects
* keep previous estimates and see how accurate they were

#### Estimating the amount of construction

#### Influences on schedule

#### Estimation vs. control

#### What to do if you're behind
* hope that you'll catch up
* expand the team
* reduce the scope of the project


### 28.4 Measurement


### 28.5 Treating programmers as people

#### How do programmers spend their time?

#### Variation in performance and quality
* individual variation
* team variation

### 28.6 Managing your manager
