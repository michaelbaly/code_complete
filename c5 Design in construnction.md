## 5.1 Design Challenges
### Design is a wicked problem
* The Tacoma Narrows Bridge

### Design is a sloppy process

### Design is about tradeoffs and priorities
* fast response rate OR minimizing development time ?

### Design involves restrictions
* time, resource are limitted.

### Design is nondeterministic
* dozens of ways to design

### Design is heuristic process

### Design is emergent
* evolve and improve through design reviews, informal discussions, experience writing the code, etc.

## 5.2 Key design concepts
* Good design depends on understanding a handful of key concepts. This section discuss the **role of complexity**, **desirable characteristics** of design, and **levels** of design.

### Software's primary technical imperative: *managing complexity*.
